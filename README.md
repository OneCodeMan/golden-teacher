Graphs TV show ratings using imdb data.

Please don't judge the way I write code based on this. This was very much rushed.
I just let my passion take over.

This was a project I had in mind for a while, and I decided to spontaneously do it on a Saturday night where I was supposed to just relax
and watch a movie and sleep early. It's almost 2 am. Woops. It's October 25, 2020. I just watched Victoria (2015) which was a ride.
Khabib subbed Gaethje earlier and he (Khabib) retired at 29-0.

## Medium TODOs
- [ ] Make x-axis not have floats
- [ ] Make y-axis for shows of the same season have the same metrics
- [ ] Add logo of TV show to personalize the graphs
- [ ] Make the graph pretty

## Hard TODOs
- [ ] Organize file structure (hard because you're gonna have to use `os` and stuff like that)
- [ ] Add title of highest rated show
- [ ] Add title of lowest rated show
- [ ] Refactor to follow best practices
